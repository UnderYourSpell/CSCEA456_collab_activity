# UAA CSCE A465 Collaborative Activity
## Computer Programming Exploits
#### Bamber, Wilson, Seto, Kageyama

### Purpose
- Define a security challenge: buffer overflows
- Propose a solution: safer coding practices and a switch to memory safe languages

### Methods
1. Demonstrated how a stack attack might work
2. Try and insert shell code into memory
3. Show how this can be prevented
4. Demonstrate safe coding practices
5. Demonstrate how race conditions can lead to unwated behavior
6. Demonstrate the importance of variable type
7. Show how these can be avoided

The idea of our project was to demonstrate a variety of ways one can use computer programming oversights to do malicious actions.
While it is not one single attack, for the purposes of learning this new concept, we all tried in different ways to show vulnerabilities
in computer programming, especially in the C language.  

We all learned a lot doing this.
Speaking for myself (Moro) trying to look at memory to insert shell code into is very...hard.
